If you want to explore a dataset off-line using the nearest neighbor paradigm, a KD-Tree might just be what you're looking for. The KD-Tree splits the $$ K- $$ dimensional space where each non-leaf node implements a hyperplane that divides the space into two halfspaces.

To illustrate the working of the K-D Tree, consider the following data sample

```python
0: (3,5)
1: (4,5)
2: (2,10)
3: (8,1)
4: (5,8)
5: (7,9)
6: (4,5)
7: (9,4)
8: (2,3)
9: (10,6)
```

Now sorting the set by both the $$ \mathbf{X} $$ and $$ \mathbf{Y} $$

```python
along X             along Y
2: (2,10)           3: (8,1)
8: (2,3)            8: (2,3)
0: (3,5)            7: (9,4)
1: (4,5)            0: (3,5)
6: (4,5)            1: (4,5)
4: (5,8)            6: (4,5)
5: (7,9)            9: (10,6)
3: (8,1)            4: (5,8)
7: (9,4)            5: (7,9)
9: (10,6)           2: (2,10)
```

We'll start by splitting the space along the $$ \mathbf{X} $$ axis.

### Building the K-D Tree

Select median along $$ \mathbf{X} $$ axis. When there are 2 possible median values, we take the lower point. Therefore the median is: `6: (4,5)`. Every point with the $$ \mathbf{X} $$ coordinate less than or equal to $$ 4 $$ is in the left subtree and the other points are in the right subtree.

## Paragraph

I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

## Images

By default, the image is centered and the image caption can be displayed at the bottom:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png)
_Full screen width and center alignment_

You can change the size of the picture:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="400"}
_400px image width_

In addition, you can use class `normal` , `left` and `right` to specify the image position (but in these case, the image caption is prohibited), for example:

- Normal position
  
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="350" class="normal"}

- Float to the left

  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="240" class="left"}

## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
