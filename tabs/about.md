I'm a fifth year Dual Degree (B.Tech + Masters by Research) student in Computer Science at the [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Kamalakar Karlapalem](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~kamal/). I'm broadly interested in problems within the intersection of Data Systems and Statistics (simply going by the courses I've taken). I'm currently exploring the area of Uncertain Data Management.
